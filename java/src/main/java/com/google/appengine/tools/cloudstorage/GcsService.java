 * used for all of the methods provided by this class. So an {@link RetriesExhaustedException} means
 * that these have failed. Retry logic is handled internally to this class, because while writing to
 * the {@link GcsOutputChannel} a request can span the boundaries of segments written to
 * {@link RawGcsService}. As a result a write call could partly succeed, making error recovery at an
 * application level next to impossible.
 *
 * Reading, deleting, and gettingMetadata are all idempotent operations. However for symmetry and
 * convenience the {@link RetryParams} are applied to these calls as well.
